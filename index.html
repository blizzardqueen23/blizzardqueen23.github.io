     Hello! I'm Serena, a current junior at Stuyvesant High School. I am interested in computer science and math, as well as machine learning and AI.<br><br>
     I am currently learning Java, but I also have a basic understanding of several other languages, including Python, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
     Most of my time is spent around my Stuyvesant life. I am a member of <a href="https://mathteam.stuy.edu/">Stuyvesant Math Team</a>, as well as Mu Alpha Theta. I am also a Senpai for Stuyvesant's CS Dojo, where I assist underclassmen with computer science. In my free time, I tutor kids for math, as well as volunteer.<br><br>
     Unfortunately, I don't have many projects right now, but I am trying to expand my portfolio. My latest project is a cognitive assistant and machine learning model using Python, as a part of MIT BWSI's Cognitive Assistant Course.<br><br>
     Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, as well as solving puzzles and attempting escape rooms. (I'm a beta tester for an <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/86275095815774/NEW-ROOM-ESCAPE-ROOM">escape room game</a> on Roblox!)<br><br>
     Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
